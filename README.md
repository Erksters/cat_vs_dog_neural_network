# cat_vs_dog_neural_network
This neural network is incomplete. It was created with tensorflow (with the help of Youtuber: sentdex ) and foreign database (from Kaggle). Read the README for this information. The goal of this model is to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.  Performance data is also found in the README
